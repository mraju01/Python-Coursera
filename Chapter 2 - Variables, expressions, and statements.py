#Constants

#Fixed Values such as number, letter and strings are called constants

#string constants use single quotes ('') or ("")

print (123) #Integer
print(98.6) #float
print("Hello World") #string

#Variables
#One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value.
# **Note: Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful and
# document what the variable is used for.**

# ðŸ“Œ They can contain both letters and numbers,
# but **they cannot start with a number**. It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is
# a good idea to begin variable names with a lowercase letter (youâ€™ll see why later).
